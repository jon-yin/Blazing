Star Bruce Willis shows up wearing bonnet and diapers in the role of \"Baby Hayes\", the as-yet-unborn offspring of David Addison (also Bruce Willis) and Maddie Hayes (Cybill Shepherd). From his vantage point in Heaven, Baby Hayes is given the low-down on his future parents by friendly angel Jerome (Joseph Maher). Alas, the episode ends with a heartbreaker for David and Maddie, but at least Baby Hayes can take comfort in the possibility that he'll eventually be added to the cast of another series like Growing Pains or The Cosby Show). This episode's curious blend of comedy and pathos is counterpointed by an opening scene in which the cast and crew promises that they'll deliver a full 22 episodes this season, come Hell or high water. (But they don't).",

As for the Three Kings, they're actually the three King Brothers, Saul (Daniel Chodos), Jim (John Hostetter) and Reuben (James Avery)--and the possibility exists that they are not so much Wise Men as wise guys!

        "summary": "First telecast in early 1985, the 2-hour pilot film for the lighthearted TV detective series Moonlighting opens with fashion model Maddie Hayes (Cybill Shepard) discovering that her business manager has skipped with her fortune. The only asset she has left is the ramshackle Blue Moon Detective Agency, manned by acerbic David Addison (Bruce Willis). Maddie takes an immediate dislike to David, while he considers her a sexual conquest-to-be. The twosome continues to bicker their way through their first case, pausing for amenities only when it appears that both of them are about to be bumped off. Once safely back in the office, their verbal guerilla warfare resumes, leading the viewer to expect marvelous things from the subsequent Moonlighting TV series. Little of the series' fabled self-consciousness (talking directly to the audience, making references to the quality of the scriptwriting, etc.) surfaces in the Moonlighting pilot, but the film works well despite this \"drawback.\" The series itself aired until May of 1989.",
