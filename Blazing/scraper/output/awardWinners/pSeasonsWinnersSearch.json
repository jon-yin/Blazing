Platt (Amy Morton) pulls strings to get Burgess (Marina Squerciati) a new partner, reassigning Officer Julie Tay (Li Jun Li) from parking enforcement. This causes friction with Commander Fogel (Ian Bedford) who claims Platt went over his head to get her the position, but there may be more to her reassignment than meets the eye. Lindsay and Halstead (Jesse Lee Soffer) take the next step in their relationship. And Antonio (Jon Seda) struggles with a big decision after receiving a job offer that seems too good to pass up.",
